# Tone Mapping

Tone mapping is a technique to map one set of colors to another to approximate the appearance of highdynamic-range (HDR) images in a medium that has a more limited dynamic range. Tone mapping
operators can be divided into two main types:
- global operators: non-linear functions based on the luminance and other global variables of the
image.
- local operators: the parameters of the non-linear function change in each pixel, according to
features extracted from the surrounding parameters.

Both operators are implemented respectively: global logarithmic operator and Durandâ€™s local operator. 

# Single Image Super Resolution

Single image super resolution (SISR) is an image restoration problem which aims to recover a highresolution (HR) image from the corresponding low-resolution (LR) image. The AI upscaling here use a Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) with PyTorch.


# Instruction for Training

Train for AI Upscaling
```
# train the SRCNN model using GPU, set learning rate=0.0005, batch size=256,
# make the program train 100 epoches and save a checkpoint every 10 epoches
:\> python train.py train --cuda --lr=0.0005 --batch-size=256 --num-epoch=100 --savefreq=10

# train the SRCNN model using CPU, set learning rate=0.001, batch size=128,
# make the program train 20 epoches and save a checkpoint every 2 epoches
:\> python train.py train --lr=0.001 --batch-size=128 --num-epoch=20 --save-freq=2

# resume training with GPU from "checkpoint.x" with saved hyperparameters
:\> python train.py resume checkpoint.x --cuda
# resume training from "checkpoint.x" and override some of saved hyperparameters
:\> python train.py resume checkpoint.x --batch-size=16 --num-epoch=200

# inspect "checkpoint.x"
:\> python train.py inspect checkpoint.x 
```

Run the code
```
:\> python main.py
or
:\> python main.py --cuda
```

2nd and 3rd option run HDR tone mapping on HDR images, then upscaled the toned image.

HDR image: **test image/hdr_images**

HDR Panorama folder: test **image/hdr_panorama/inputs/**

# Panorama Page

3rd option menu, select **checkpoint.best** as trained model and **test image/hdr_panorama/inputs/** for HDR images input

Move the slider to change the scale of Image Upscale, Default is 3x
